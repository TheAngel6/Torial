        <h3>1. Frequently Asked Questions:</h3>
        <p>QUESTION Â How can I join a clan?
            <br>
            <br>
            The username box, type in your username like so: "[CLAN] user"Replace "CLAN" and "user" with names of your choice.<br>
            The ranking of your clan can be seen on the clan leaderboard. <br>
            The name of a clan must have less than 8 letters. <br>
            Players with the same clan tag are always assigned to the same team.<br>
            <br>
            <br>
            QUESTION Â How do I create a clan?
            <br>
            <br>
            The mechanism is the same as in the prior answer.<br>
            You append the clan tag to your name. <br>
            A clan must win at least one alliance game in order to be listed on the clan leaderboard.<br>
            Every day, clans with less than 0.001 points will be removed from the list.<br>
            <br>
            <br>
            QUESTION Â How can I play with my friends?
            <br>
            <br>
            You can click on "More" in the main menu and select lobby 2. In this lobby, fewer players are active.<br>
            This is a good place to play with friends.<br>
            <br>
            <br>
            QUESTION Â When do special games take place?
            <br>
            <br>
            Battle royale contests take place every 30 minutes at xx:00 and xx:30 (for example, at 12:30, 13:00, 13:30, and so on).<br>
            Alliance contests take place every 30 minutes at xx:15 and xx:45.<br>
            Rated one-vs-one games take place every 5 minutes at xx:00, xx:05, and so on.<br>
            Zombie games take place every 5 minutes at xx:03, xx:08, and so on.<br>
            <br>
            <br>
            QUESTION Â How do I create a one-vs-one account?
            <br>
            <br>
            The one-vs-one account is created automatically for you. <br>
            If you play the game in the browser, make sure to allow cookies. <br>
            You can check the password of your account in the main menu. <br>
            Type "password" into the username input field. <br>
            When a number other than 0 appears, your account is valid.<br>
            It's recommended that you store your password safely. <br>
            This way, you will keep your account when you delete the app or clear cookies. <br>
            If the password gets lost, you have to build up your ELO from zero again. <br>
            Your account will lose one ELO point per day. <br>
            Once it reaches 0, your account will be deleted.<br>
            <br>
            <br>
            QUESTION Â How can I transfer my one-vs-one account from mobile to desktop?
            <br>
            <br>
            Get your password, as described in the prior question, and paste it on your desktop machine. <br>
            There, open Territorial.io, type "password" into the username box, replace the password, and press enter.<br>
            The same logic applies in reverse.<br>
            <br>
            <br>
            QUESTION Â How can I change the color of my territory?
            <br>
            <br>
            In the main menu, you can click the little icon with the color grid in the bottom left corner. <br>
            Here you can set the RGB values of your territory.<br>
            <br>
            <br>
            QUESTION Â How can I create my own maps?
            <br>
            <br>
            You can upload your own map and play it as a single player. <br>
            Go to the main menu and click on "Singleplayer". <br>
            Then drag and drop your image file into the window. <br>
            This feature is only available for desktop users.<br>
            To create full custom single-player scenarios see under Section 5.<br>
            <br>
            <br>
            QUESTION Â Is it possible to report users with offensive usernames?
            <br>
            <br>
            We recommend enabling the "Hide Usernames" button in the main menu to hide usernames.<br>
            <br>
            <br>
            QUESTION Â How can I report a bug?
            <br>
            <br>
            You may report a bug at this email address: davidtschacher@gmail.com <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            QUESTION Â How can I support Territorial.io?
            <br>
            <br>
            You can support Territorial.io by playing it and by creating and sharing content about it.<br>

        <h3>2. The balance</h3>
        <p> balance is visible in the mostly green rectangle at the top of the screen.<br>
            You will see that this value steadily increases. <br>
            Its maximum value depends on your territorial size. <br>
            The balance can also be seen on the map below (above in one-vs-one games) the username. <br>
            Therefore, you can always see how high the balances of other players are.<br>
            <br>
            You earn interest on your balance. <br>
            Therefore, the higher your balance, the higher your interest income. <br>
            Furthermore, you can use a part of your balance to attack enemy territory. <br>
            How much of your balance you want to invest depends on the percentage bar at the bottom of the screen.<br>
            <br>
            The balance also represents the strength of your defense. <br>
            The higher your balance, the stronger your defense.<br>
            <br>
            The balance therefore abstracts the concepts of economy, population, and army.

        <h3>3. Borders</h3>
        <p>
            When you conquer new territories, you should always take care about which countries will border you. <br>
            Sometimes it's better to not conquer a weak "intermediary" between you and a strong enemy. <br>
            There are also some other interesting strategies related to borders. <br>
            You can think of the border as the only place where your forces defend your country. <br>
            Therefore, it's a good strategy to keep your border as compact as possible. <br>
            Your border may also adjoin mountains, the ocean, or the edge of the map. <br>
            This type of border doesn't bind your defensive forces. <br>
            This also explains why it's so hard to attack island nations.<br>
            <br>
            To conquer a nation completely, your attack forces must be at least twice as strong as the defense forces of the enemy.

        <h3>4. Maximum income</h3>
        <p>
            I (the creator of Territorial.io) want to discuss this concept here shortly. <br>
            You may already have seen that your interest income can be much higher than your territorial income. <br>
            Your maximum balance is equal to 150 times your pixel count. <br>
            Your maximum interest income is equal to 100 times your pixel count. <br>
            The balance turns red once peak income is reached. <br>
            At this point, you can only increase your income by gaining more territory.<br>
            <br>
            I will discuss a short example: Let's assume you control 1000 pixels. <br>
            Your maximum income is set at a balance of 100 x 1000 = 100 000. <br>
            If your balance is lower or higher than 100 000, your interest income is lower. <br>
            Your maximum balance in this case is 150 x 1000, or 150 000.<br>
            <br>
            Note that the interest rate decreases at the beginning of the game. <br>
            Furthermore, the interest rate is proportional to the size of your territory.<br>
            <br>
            In one-vs-one endgames in the case of equally distributed territories, the best strategy (in my opinion) is to repeatedly attack at maximum income (i.e., when your balance turns red).

        <h3>5. Custom single-player scenarios</h3>
        <p>
            You can load JSON files into the game. <br>
            These files can include player information like spawn coordinates, colors, and team IDs. <br>
            And best of all, you can create your own maps. <br>
            Be informed: Water is definied as a color where the blue value is bigger than the red and green value. <br>
            Mountain is definied as a color where red, green and blue have all the same value (gray).<br>
            An example JSON file can be downloaded here:<br>
